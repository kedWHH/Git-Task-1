Hi!
I'm Kedar Sivaramakrishnan, and I'm a 12th grader from Vizag. My sister studies in Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham Coimbatore branch, ECE B.

I have quite an interest in programming and CyberSec and look forward to a job in PenTesting.
My OS is Kali Linux and I hate Windows on this laptop since it's really slow, so I deleted it.

I also play guitar and follow the band Polyphia heavily.

Much love
Ked769
